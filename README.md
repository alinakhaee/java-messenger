# Java messenger
a simple messenger with java and socket programming.
this messenger is like telegram (with various number of bugs :)))) )
I have used the socket programming of java to create a server and make a connection between client and the server.

## How to run
to run this project, first you have to install javaFX(jsk 8) and socket library of java. then you should first run the server and after that run two instances of the client app to test the application.

## Features
you can create accounts and log in to an existing account. then the app will automacially show your previous messages and show all the accounts you have contact with.
you can send files (up to 200Kb ðŸ˜‚ )
